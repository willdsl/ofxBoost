ofxBoost
========

ofxBoost is acollection of Compiled Boost libraries and headers for OSX and Windows based on version 1.46 and compiled with GCC 4.6+. For usage, link ofxBoost to the libraries you require. Instead of adding individual header files to your project, simply point your compiler to the correct header search paths. It is recommended to drag and drop the libraries to Xcode projects on Mac operatings systems, and to add them to the library include paths for Windows operating systems.
